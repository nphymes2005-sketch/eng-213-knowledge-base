# Refusing GenAI in Writing Studies: A Quickstart Guide 
----
#### Refusal of GenAI

It is important to stay informed and up to date on the different information coming out about AI technology, especially with how many different areas of life it has the potential to impact. Although there are downsides to AI usage, it is still a tool in some instances, so it is important that people determine where they will draw the line. There are various versions of how people define refusal because it can vary depending on person. The text describes their own use of the word refusal in the following quote: ". . . the range of ways that individuals and/or groups consciously and intentionally choose to refuse GenAI use, when and where we are able to do so" (Sano-Francini et. al). 

##### "Tools" and "Collaborators"
- Limits credit of user input and effort
- Underestimations and overestimations of ability and different uses for AI
- Limited knowledge of capabilities
 
##### Replacing Humans?
- Lack of diversity
- False accusations of AI generated work (Is human writing that similar to AI?)
- Brainstorms, revises, and drafts for writers (Loss of critical thinking?)

#### Connections to Other Class Discussions

When looking at AI, it is important to consider the intent behind its use. Does the end justify the means? This point is brought up when looking at algorithms in an earlier reading, which Couch discusses in their post. 

"Intent is inheritely hard to gauge though, and as such there is a lot of overlap between a lie and misinformation from an outside perspective, and even sometimes from the creator of the statement."

Tying in this idea of misinformation is important as well when looking at AI usage and where people decided to draw the lines of their refusal. AI does have the potential to create misinformation. When using it, this needs to be considered, especially with the limited knowledge people have on the capabilities of AI technology. 

##### Classmate 2: 2025-09-23-smidebush.md
It is also important to consider long-term influence of content when working with AI. If misinformation should be considered, so should the influence of misinformation and similar products of AI usage. In a post by Smidebush, long-tails are discussed, showing the value of considering this. 

"This refers to the long-term influence of the content on the audience and how it affects or changes their lives after watching or consuming the media."

##### Classmate 3: 2025-09-09-staton.md
It is important to look at the potential AI technology has. Because technology continues to grow and develop over time, people can expect this from AI technology as well. This point is brought up in Staton's post in the following quote:

"Writing has indeed shifted from print to digital, and the conventions for that have changed."
